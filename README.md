# README - Kerberos/Docker

![Build status](https://github.com/criteo/kerberos-docker/actions/workflows/kerberos-docker.yml/badge.svg)

Kerberos/Docker is a project to run easily a **MIT Kerberos V5** architecture in a cluster of **docker containers**. It is really useful for running integration tests of projects using Kerberos or for learning and testing Kerberos solutions and administration.

See: [MIT Kerberos V5](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

## Prerequisites

Use an **operating system compatible with docker**, and install:  
- **docker-ce** (without `sudo` for running the docker command and with `overlay2` driver).  
- **docker-compose**
- **GNU Make** (if not already available).  
- **GNU Bash** (if not already available).

Only if you want to generate other docker configurations, install:
- **Python 3** (if not already available, with `pip` and `venv`).

Only if you want to use java on your host machine:
- **Java 8 and Maven 3** (if not already available).  

To check the compatible version, see the traces of the `Check version` on GitHub actions (CI) web interface, see [here](https://github.com/criteo/kerberos-docker/actions).  

To run tests, install **Bats**, see `./.ci/install.sh`.

Note:
- For Linux and MacOS workstations, it works on all distributions. 
- For Windows workstation, it works on [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) 
with Ubuntu, but connect to the docker container to interact with the Kerberos server. 

## Usage

After installation, there are 3 containers with a web server on each one to check if it turns:

- `krb5-machine-example-com`
- `krb5-kdc-server-example-com`
- `krb5-service-example-com`

The goal is to connect from `krb5-machine-example-com` to `krb5-service-example-com` with ssh and Kerberos authentication (using GSSAPIAuthentication).

Here cluster architecture:

</p>


## Installation

Execute:

~~~
make install
~~~

It will use the `./build-ubuntu-example-com` folder, with docker containers under `Ubuntu` and with the kerberos realm `EXAMPLE.COM`.
If you want to use another OS for the docker containers and/or other  Kerberos realm, you need to use `make gen-conf` see `Prerequisites` section.

See `Makefile` with `make usage` for all commands.

## Uninstallation

Execute:

~~~
make clean
~~~

To delete `network-analyser`, do `./network-analyser/clean-network-analyser.sh`.

For Ubuntu operating system on the docker container:

To delete `ubuntu:22.04` and `minimal-ubuntu:latest` docker images do `docker rmi ubuntu:22.04 minimal-ubuntu`.

## Possible improvements

* Add LDAP as database for the Kerberos architecture
* Add other connectors and service (postgresql, mongodb, nfs, hadoop) only OpenSSH for the moment
* Add Java, Python or C to connect with Kerberos authentication


## Test and Continous Integration

This project uses [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and
[Bash Automated Testing System (BATS)](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core).

See https://github.com/criteo/kerberos-docker/actions.

After installing `bast` (see version in Prerequisites part), you can test with `make test`.

## Network analyzer

You can create a [wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) instance running in a docker container built from docker image named `network-analyser`.

See more details in `./network-analyser/README.md`.

## Debug and see traces

You can connect with an interactive session to a docker container:

~~~
docker exec -it <container_name_or_id> bash
~~~

To debug Kerberos client or server:

~~~
export KRB5_TRACE=/dev/stdout
~~~

To debug ssh client:

~~~~
ssh -vvv username@host
~~~~

To debug the ssh server:

~~~~
/usr/sbin/sshd -f /etc/ssh/sshd_config -d -e
~~~~

## Troubleshooting

**Kerberos services**

On `krb5-kdc-server-example-com` docker container, there are 2 Kerberos services `krb5-admin-service` and `krb5-kdc`:

~~~
supervisorctl status
~~~

See all opened ports on a machine:

~~~
netstat -tulpn
~~~


Check that each machine has a synchronized time (with `ntp` protocol and `date` to check).

See [Troubleshooting](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-latest/doc/admin/troubleshoot.html) and
[Kerberos reserved ports](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.5/krb5-1.5.4/doc/krb5-admin/Configuring-Your-Firewall-to-Work-With-Kerberos-V5.html).

**Conflict private IP addresses**

To create `example.com` network docker, the private sub-network `10.5.0.0/24`
should be free and private IP addresses `10.5.0.0/24` should be free also. Check
your routing table with `route -n`, test free IP addresses with
`ping -c 1 -w 2 <host>`, and check request paths with `traceroute <host>`.

If the issue persists, you can do `make clean` or `docker network rm example.com`.

**Working on your computer (host machine) for debugging code**

Modify your `/etc/hosts` to resolve bidirectionally IP addresses with DNS of
the Kerberos cluster:

~~~
# /etc/hosts
# ...

# Kerberos cluster
# IP FQDN hostname
10.5.0.1	krb5-machine-example-com.example.com krb5-machine-example-com
10.5.0.2	krb5-kdc-server-example-com.example.com krb5-kdc-server-example-com
10.5.0.3	krb5-service-example-com.example.com krb5-service-example-com

# ...
~~~

You can `ping krb5-kdc-server-example-com|10.5.0.2` Kerberos KDC server, and check if
Kerberos server port is opened: `nmap -A 10.5.0.2/32 -p 88` (or if SSH
server port: `nmap -A 10.5.0.3/32 -p 22`).

Now you can debug code and do `kinit bob` on the host machine directly.

The order of `entries` and `names` is important in `/etc/hosts`.
To resolve name from an IP address, the resolver takes the first one (horizontally) if multiple names
are possible; and to resolve IP address from the name , the resolver takes the first entry (vertically)
if multiple IP addresses are possible: You can use `resolveip <IP|name>`, `getent hosts <IP|name>`
or just take a look at `/etc/hosts`.
